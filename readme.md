# Hut

### What the honk is a Hut?

A Hut partakes in a shared experience. A Hut may define the rules of how an experience plays out, or subscribe to the rules of another Hut. Getting started, it's safe to think of a Hut as a client or server.

### Why use Hut?

- **Architecture Elimination:** Focus 100% on logic that is specific to whatever you're building!
- **Dependency Elimination:** All required tools come included in Hut
- **Client Anosticism:** With minimal configuration any Hut becomes accessible via a client's browser, command-line, desktop app
- **Platform Agnosticism:** Hut runs on any supported platform - only some minimal configuration required (platform support is improving with time!)
- **Persistence for free:** Never think about data persistence - simply tell Hut something like: "run my app using storage block A", and your app's state is automatically resumed and persisted!
- **SSL for free:** Hut includes an [acme](https://letsencrypt.org/2019/03/11/acme-protocol-ietf-standard.html) implementation - you'll never think about certifying ("padlocking") the domains used for your Huts
- **Observability for free:** Huts have a "subconscious", a stream of data representing decisions being made and resource availability; Hut comes with a built-in "therapist", which is a tool for analyzing this subconscious
- **SEO for free:** You'll never need to touch html (or anything apart from javascript) when building with Hut; behind the scenes Hut renders html for you, handling seo in the process
- **Insights for free:** Minimal configuration enables insight collection on your userbase
